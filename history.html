							<p>The need to support writing systems for electronic communication was apparent from the adent of such technologies.</p>
							<p>The first international standard was the ITA1 for use with Teleprinters.It was developed from the earlier Baudot Code. This was replaced by ITA2 in 1924. ITA2 saw much greater adoption and was the main international standard until 1963.</p>
							<p>The development of ASCII in 1963 replaced ITA2, While it was the most common character encoding in computing and later in web applications, it was not the only standard in use, leading to research intitiatives for a universally accepted encoding. This led to the creation of Unicode in 1991. </p>
							<p>Unicode is now the most common standard, specifically the version UTF-8. ASCII remained dominant for decades, but the Web 2.0 era saw UTF-8 overtake it in 2008. </p>
							<p>UTF overtook ASCII for two primary reasons: alphabet and Google. ASCII could only dispaly characters in the Latin alphabet. UTF, in its various forms, can display the characters of any language. ASCII ceased to be a common writing tool because a sizeable percentage of the world's population could not write with it.</p>
							<p>The importance of the connection between language and culture cannot be overstated, and the technological means to communicate function as an extension of culture. Although UTF had already existed for over a decade, it did not immedietly overtake ASCII as Although UTF had already existed for over a decade, it did not immedietly overtake ASCII as "Such a simple replacement would be extremely unlikely because the mediational means—that is, the technology—is tied inextricably to social and cultural structures, on the one hand, and individual goals and practices on the other" (Haas, p. 212). Individuals writing web pages may have recognized that UTF could be used in place of their language specific character encoding, but doing so could have cultural identity implications. Thus ASCII, UTF, and multiple other charachter encoding co-existed for decades, as
								"rival technologies may be copresent at any given moment" (Haas, p. 222). </p>
							<p>As Google rose to become the world's top search engine it needed an international standard for charset elements. It could not use ASCII for pages in non Latin alphanets. Prior to UTF there was a greater number of charset options, often one for every type of writing system or alphabet. ASCII had been dominant because most of the internet
								in its early years was in English or another language based on Latin script. Because of how much internet development was taking place within the United States, character encodings based around English had a tremendous power advantage over those that did not. When Google began using UTF standards it took only 2 years (2006-2008) for it to go from one of the least used to the most used character encoding system.</p>
