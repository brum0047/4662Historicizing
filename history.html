							<h1>History of character endcoding</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The need to support writing systems for electronic communication was apparent from the adent of such technologies.</p>
							<p>The first international standard was the ITA1 for use with Teleprinters.It was developed from the earlier Baudot Code. This was replaced by ITA2 in 1924. ITA2 saw much greater adoption and was the main international standard until 1963.</p>
							<p>The development of ASCII in 1963 replaced ITA2, While it was the most common character encoding in computing and later in web applications, it was not the only standard in use, leading to research intitiatives for a universally accepted encoding. This led to the creation of Unicode in 1991. </p>
							<p>Unicode is now the most common standard, specifically the version UTF-8. ASCII remained dominant for decades, but the Web 2.0 era saw UTF-8 overtake it in 2008. </p>
