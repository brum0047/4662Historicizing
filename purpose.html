							<h1>The charset element</h1>
							<h1>Purpose of character encoding</h1>

							<p>Intro<br/></p>
							<p>When thinking of a soft web element with connection to the print industry, my mind turned towards many of the basic elements of printing technology. I thought of the typesets used by mass newspaper printers an even earlier systems used for printing early books. What characters could be included in a typeset varied depending on the manufacturer
								and the country. I wish to explain how the current character encoding standards came about and how earlier print industry standards influenced the development of the standards we use today.</p>
							<p>The purpose of the charset element is as an encoding system for character.</p>
							<p>It standarizes the encoding of characters for the interchanging of text in electronic form.</p>
							<p>When included in the head of the HTML document it will create an encoding reference for all displayed text within the document, determining its appearance in HTML. </p>
							<p>The styles of the characters themselves are known as fonts, and the charset element should not be confused with those that determine fonts. While a font will determine what how a character can be displayed, the charset determines if that character is even allowed on the page.</p>
							<p>The charset functions as a type of sign system (Haas, p. 212) that determines what signs the composer of a page or document may use to communicate. It restricts the signs to a set of characters that are stored as binary code. It is a writing tool that determines just what characters can be written. </p>
